## How to Run

>Clone The Repo.

>download the world geo json data from
[here](https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json/blob/master/countries.geo.json) name it world_countries.json and place it in your root directory

>Start up a webserver.
I suggest using something like [Servez](https://github.com/greggman/servez) to boot quickly without having to deal with the command line

>Check it out on your local host!
